Exception handling is done to catch runtime errors. For example in reading files, the compiler won't know when will the error occur middle, end or beginning of the file.
So, we use exception handling to catch the error and handle it.

Q: What is the difference between throw and throws?
throw is used to throw an exception explicitly.
throws is used to declare an exception.

main method mainly doesn't throw an exception, because no method is above it to catch the exception.

we can catch the exception of other methods in main method.
but, we can also catch an exception in a method which is above the method which throws an exception.

The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception, 
either it received the exception from below method or another method and it doesn't want to catch it in its method,
so, it throws the exception to the above method.
