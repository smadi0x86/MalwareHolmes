**The Malware Holmes is a Java project that performs static analysis on executable files to detect malicious behavior and potential security risks.**
**It leverages native code written in C to access low-level capabilities and enhance the analysis process.**

## Features

The Malware Analyzer project offers the following features:

1. **Static Analysis**: The project performs static analysis on files to identify potential malware and security risks.
2. **PE Analysis**:
3. **Container Protection:** The project runs dynamic analysis on executables in an isolated lightweight docker container which prevents any malware execution damage to your host machine.
4. **Signature-based Detection**: It utilizes a signature database to match known malware signatures and identify malicious files based on hash values.
5. **Directory Monitoring**: The project provides a directory monitoring service that continuously scans a specified directory for new files and analyzes them in real-time.
6. **Native Code Integration**: Native C code is integrated using Java Native Interface (JNI) to access low-level capabilities and perform advanced analysis techniques.

## Prerequisites

***To run the MalwareHolmes project, you need to have the following software installed on your system:***

- *Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher*
- *Optional (for development): Apache Maven build tool*
- *Optional (for development): GCC compiler (for C code compilation)*

## Usage

### Manual Build  

***To build the project, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:***
```bash
mvn clean package
```
This command builds the project and packages it into a JAR file. The resulting JAR file can be found in the `/target` directory.

***After building the project, you can run it using the following command:***
```bash
java -Djava.library.path="...\maven-final-programming-quickpick\src\main\java" -jar target/maven-final-programming-quickpick-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
**You will be prompted to enter the path of the directory you want to monitor for malware.**

***When Specifying the library path (dlls):***
```
If you saved the project in C drive it will be -Djava.library.path="C:\maven-final-programming-quickpick\src\main\java"
```


## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

The Malware Analyzer project includes CI/CD pipelines for automated building, testing, and analysis. These pipelines are configured using GitHub Actions.

### Unit Testing

The unit testing workflow is triggered on each push to the repository. It runs unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented methods.

### Maven Build

The Maven build workflow is triggered on each push to the repository. It performs the Maven build process for the project.

### CodeQL Analysis

The CodeQL analysis workflow is triggered on each push to the repository. It performs static analysis using CodeQL to identify security issues and potential vulnerabilities.

### Dependabot

Dependabot is configured to automate the creation of pull requests for any detected security issues or dependency updates. It ensures that your project stays up to date with the latest security patches and dependencies.

These CI/CD pipelines streamline the development process, automating tasks such as building, testing, and code analysis.

These pipelines enable continuous integration, automated testing, and code analysis, providing confidence in the project's stability and security.
